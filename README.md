# Wally's Widgets App

Wally's widget is a simple app that allows you to order widgets from Wally. With the environment at the forefront of Wally's thoughts, Wally will despatch the lowest number of packs possible to make the order efficient, eco-friendly and importantly cost effective.

Packs come in a variety of sizes:
- 250 widgets (xtra small pack)
- 500 widgets (small pack)
- 1,000 widgets (medium pack)
- 2,000 widgets (large pack)
- 5,000 widgets (xtra large pack)

The app allows you to enter your required number of widgets and it calculates which packs to send to you.

## Functionality - What does the App do?
### Primary 
The primary functionality of the App is for users to order widgets. The user clicks on the Place Order button, they enter the required number of widgets and the App provides the user with the widget packs that they should expect to receive. Users will also receive a unique tracking number beginning with WW.

### Secondary 
The secondary function of the App is to allow returning users to click on the Track Order button on the homepage and enter their existing order number. This will retrieve the customers order and display it for the user to review.



## Future features
- Wally is always thinking of how to improve and in the future, the app will allow you to enter your email and you will receive a copy of your order tracking number direct to your inbox.
- Wally aims to bring flexibility to his customers, with new functionality in the pipeline which will allow customers to track their widget order and make updates if they want to order more of the wonderous widgets.
