//Building Wally's Widgets
//The key to the algorithm is dividing by the highest number of widgets first and then working down through each number

//Create a very basic input box.
//A function to capture the target value
//Convert the e.target.value to a number
//Pass the number into the algorithm
//Algorithm returns the number of

Deploy
//Use Vercel to deploy the App

//TESTING
//Add unit testing to test the algorithm

Stretch Goals

//Download JEST and implement tests on the widget functionality

//Render the order box onClick of the order button on a new page

//DB
//Set up a DB and connect the DB to the order function
//DB stores the number of widgets ordered by a customer and sends them back an order number
//Set up relevant Fetch requests

//Build a home screen with the options to track an order or create a new order

//Refactor the widgets algorithm to make it look tidier
